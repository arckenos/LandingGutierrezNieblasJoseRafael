    <h2> Game Develop </h2>
    <p class = "texto-comun">
      I have always really liked video games and with the approach to programming, I began to be very interested in the process,
       of how to create them, all the variety of knowledge that must be acquired are quite interesting to me, from programming, designing,
       compose, among several activities that the development of a video game can have, all of them seem quite entertaining to me, however still
       I do not develop a complete video game as I would like, I have only participated in events such as game jams and made a video game together with some colleagues
       as a project of a subject, but in the future I plan to create one with several ideas that I have in mind.
