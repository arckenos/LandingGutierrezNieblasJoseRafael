  My name is José Rafael Gutiérrez Nieblas, I am 20 years old and I was born here in Cd.Obregón Sonora, I am currently in the 6th semester of the Software Engineering degree. Normally what I do in my free time is listen to music, play video games or watch movies. One of my hobbies I could say is researching video game development, I find it quite interesting and I would like to be able to dedicate myself to that. When I grow up I want to work as a software developer in a good company and be able to live fully, I would also like to be able to develop video games independently.
